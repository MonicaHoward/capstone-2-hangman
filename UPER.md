<h1>The Problem Solving Framework : 'UPER'</h1>

* U = "Understand"
* P = "Plan"
* E = "Execute"
* R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
* I need to make a hangman game in the terminal where users can type in a letter guess and game logic decides if letter guessed is in the current word. 
* Head
* Body
* left Arm
* Right Arm
* Left Leg
* Right Leg
* 6 guesses
<h2>
    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>
* Have a Main class to implement methods logic from GameLogic class
* Use Swing for UI
*
*
*
*
*
*
<h2>
    3. Executing the Plan
</h2>
* Methods for:
  * choosing word to guess
* storing current letter guess  
* comparing letter guessed to index of current word for guessing
* evaluating letter guessed
* storing all letters guessed
* store/increment wins
* store increment losses

<h2>
    4. Reflection / Refactor
</h2>
* Could move hangman "board" to seperate class. 
* give myself more time to allow for learning Java Swing
